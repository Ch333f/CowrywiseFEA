## Instructions and Mockups

Using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers), you're to create a mini unsplash clone using the mockups and design below as a guide. 

- The design uses a staggered grid to present photos from the API, **note** the first row containing the photos overlap the backdrop behind the search bar.
- The names of the author and photo location should be fetched from the API
- Use a tint overlay on top of the images to give the text good contrast, should an image have a light background.
- Implement loading placeholders to provide feedback to users while fetching data from the API
- On clicking an image, show a modal of the image in the best resolution that doesn't take too long to download
